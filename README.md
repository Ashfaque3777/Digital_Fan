# Digital Fan

**Digital Fan** is a web-based project that simulates a rotating fan with adjustable speed. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project features a rotating fan animation and a button to control the fan speed.

## Features

- **Rotating Fan**: The fan blades rotate continuously using CSS animations.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Click the button to cycle through 30 different speed settings.
- **Responsive Design**: The fan and button are styled to be responsive and centered on the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the fan and button.
- **CSS3**: For styling the fan and animating the blades.
- **JavaScript**: For adjusting the speed of the fan based on button clicks.
